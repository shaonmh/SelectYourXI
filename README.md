## 3 Key Features

1. **Tab-based View Switching**  
   Users can toggle between "Available" and "Selected" players using interactive buttons.

2. **Dynamic Rendering**  
   Player lists are conditionally rendered depending on the active tab — displayed as cards for "Available" and as a list for "Selected".

3. **Modular & Scalable Code**  
   Clean separation of logic and styles makes it easy to scale the app with more player data or UI enhancements.
